# Why this library?

* DatePickerDialog & TimePickerDialog are not retained on orientation change, you'd do a lot of work to retain them, this library simplify that.
* Its simple to use.
* Its Customizable(Support Custom Themes). 
* Minimum API is 16, but it'll probably work in API 9 and above, just make sure you test it out (we use `Support Fragment`).
